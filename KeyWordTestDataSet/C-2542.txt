The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has established Guidelines for the Certification of Cooking Skills for Japanese Cuisine in Foreign Countries as of April 2016. This system lays out specific standards that private bodies may use to recognize foreign chefs who have acquired given levels of knowledge and cooking skills necessary for the preparation of Japanese cuisine, to help ensure that the appeals of Japanese food and dietary culture, as well as of Japanese agricultural and marine products, are appropriately and effectively communicated throughout the world.* And through it, the private sector is able to position itself as a driving force in promoting efforts to certify Japanese cuisine cooking skills, increasing the number of certified individuals, and fostering further growth in foreign chefs who have acquired the appropriate knowledge and skills for preparation of Japanese cuisine, all with the ultimate goal of further strengthening the global reputation of Japanese food and dietary culture and expanding consumption of Japanese agricultural and marine products. To that end, TOW Co., Ltd. is actively engaged as the Application/Management Body of the Certification System. As of March 2021, it has approbated 11 certifying bodies, which have in turn recognized 14 individual chefs as meeting Gold Certification standards, 187 meeting Silver, and 389 meeting Bronze. Though the COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a significant blow to the food service industry worldwide, TOW Co., Ltd. remains committed to carrying out its missions, and to encouraging all foreign chefs aspiring to obtain the knowledge and skills to properly prepare Japanese cuisine. It is our hope that the creation and sharing of this video introducing the System for Certification of Cooking Skills for Japanese Cuisine will help fulfill those goals. *Certification standards Gold  Those who have approximately two years practical experience in a Japanese restaurant located in Japan whose head chef is Japanese and are deemed to have acquired knowledge and skills specified.
